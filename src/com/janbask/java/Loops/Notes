Loops: Repetitive tasks
       1-> while loop
        variable
        while(condition)
        {
          I/D;
        }
       2-> for loop
               for(variable; condition; I/D)
               {

               }

       3-> advanced for loop [for each loop]

       //while loop : if we are not sure about number of iterations
